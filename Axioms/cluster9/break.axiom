break as these elements:
1.change from integrity in an object
	solid object: 
		a.barrier: something that has integrity and thus can act as a barrier. -> break=cause a change from having such integrity
		
			2. when a barrier breaks, then there is a [sudden] change (e.g., change to existence/revelation)
		
		b. a non-barrier object: an object is separated into pieces
		-> for some objects (like a wall) this separation into pieces entails falling down
			3. so "a change in something that causes it do decline" is also turned into a sense of "break"
4.sudden change
